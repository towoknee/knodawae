        <p>"Guess I'll just shove the coin wherever," you think. "I really don't feel like thinking about this stuff anymore."</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, you do not get the results you wanted. Somehow, you ended up causing an infinite loop and you cloned the red creature an infinite number of times! The area is absolutely packed to the brim with copies of that guy, and it's getting difficult to move or even breathe. There is no ice cream here for you, only suffering. It's not a good time. You crawl towards the door and barely make it back into the chamber that had almost been flooded only a short time before. That peril seems like a dream compared to how bad you almost had it just now.</p>
        <p>You're almost too afraid to try going back to the bright place with all the candy to find the true wae, but when you muster up the courage to do so, there's only one copy of the red guy there, probably the original. You look at him with inquisitive eyes, but he only shrugs at you.</p>
