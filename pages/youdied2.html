        <p>You're trying to spit some knowledge, but you just can't! Or, whatever knowledge you are spitting, it's not enough! You can sense the water level rising, and... is it getting faster? Is the moment of your demise coming faster than either of you had anticipated?</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the sound stops. In its place, you can hear a noise not unlike what you can hear from your own draining bathtub at home. Has the water found some way to get out of your chamber? It looks like you're saved, after all!</p>
        <p>Wait, no, there it is again. There's the water coming in again. It looks like you've gotten another chance, but who knows how many times your luck will hold?</p>
