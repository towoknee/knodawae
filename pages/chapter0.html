        <p>As you open your eyes, a bright light from above floods over you, which doesn't help a splitting headache you didn't know you had until now. Sitting up, you rub the back of your head and turn to your right. You see something red and spiky in a sharp contrast against the blue, blue sky above.</p>
        <p>"Is that a gosh darned hedgehog?" you say to yourself.</p>
        <p>Much to your surprise, the red blob looks down at you. Two bulbous, dark eyes stare out at you from what you quickly realize is its face. You can't tear your gaze away from this mysterious creature.</p>
        <p>"I'm an echidna, you norm," you hear as its lips begin to flap in what you can only guess is supposed to be speech. Curiously, you can understand the sounds it makes, which remind you of English, with a thick accent not unlike that of the old neighborhood ice cream truck man. Good old Lashkar Singh. What you wouldn't give for him to sell you another Sonic the Hedgehog-shaped pop just like in your childhood... However, as much as you wish for a refreshing sweet treat, you have bigger things to worry about.</p>
        <p>Where are you? And what is the deal with this animal? More and more questions surge through your mind.</p>
        <p>"You probably want to get out of here, right?" says the creature, as if he can see into your thoughts. You nod. "Then follow me. I can show you <i>the wae</i>." He extends a white-gloved hand in your direction. Do you accept?</p>
