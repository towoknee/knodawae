        <p>Try as you might, you cannot get these floating blue things to leave. You're just about ready to give it up when the red fella puts a hand on your shoulder.</p>
        <p>"Are you sure you're ready? You may want to review what I was telling you. While you're at it, here are some tips for you."</p>
        <p>* Although they look similar, there's a distinction between ints and floats. Whenever you see a decimal place, you should be thinking it's a float.</p>
        <p>* Generally, if there's a letter from the alphabet in your variable's value, it's probably a string.</p>
        <p>* The convention used in this document is camelCase, for internal consistency.</p>
        <p>* Variable names are case sensitive!</p>
