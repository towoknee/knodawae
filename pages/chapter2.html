            Chapter 2: No Time For Guessing
        </h1>
        <br>
        
        <div align = left>
            <p>The trail leads you to the mouth of a cave. A cool wind blows out from the shadows. Below your feet, you can feel a distant rumbling. At the red hombre's urging, you enter. It seems as though the passageway is narrowing as you get deeper in, but you eventually reach a wider chamber, barely lit by the sun from outside. You can see a metal door that you can only assume leads out the other end.</p>
            <p>Before you have a chance to do anything, you hear a sudden slamming sound. The whole cave is plunged into darkness. As you whip around in search of the sound's source, you notice that the cave entrance has been blocked off! Besides this, you hear a sound like trickling water into the chamber. If it's what you think it is, the chamber will soon fill with water and kill both of you. What are you going to do?</p>
            <p>"This is not the wae," you hear the voice of the red boi from near you. "Do you know where the door is?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah," you reply as you climb onto a rock trying to avoid the water slowly pooling up on the floor. You catch yourself thinking, <i>God rest my soul...</i> but you can't give up here!</p>
            <p>"You might be able to open that door with some more knowledge. You need something new, something more powerful, though..." He climbs up beside you and thinks for a moment before it looks like an idea hits him. "What you need is operations."</p>
            <p>"What the he-"</p>
            <p>"There are a few different operations in Python. All the arithmetic operators you are familiar with already, like <span class='codefont'>+</span> and <span class='codefont'>-</span>, are usable here. That's all here, but there's also one new operator, the <span class='codefont'>modulo (%)</span>. It's like division, but instead of returning the quotient, it gives you <span class='codefont'>the remainder</span>. So, <span class='codefont'>12 % 5 = 2</span>. Also, you can do exponentiation with <span class='codefont'>**</span>. You can try experimenting with different operations on two different classes, but you won't always be able to get them to work. For example, you can add strings together, which will just attach one to the end of the other, but you can't subtract strings from each other. When you convert a float to an int, all the things after the decimal point are lost!</p>
            <p>Do you know about the order of operations? If you don't, you can try to remember it using PEMDAS. The computer will just interpret your expressions from left to right following this, so if you want things to be done in a particular order, use parentheses. You might have to use a lot, but it's better than the computer seeing your instructions the wrong way and messing up everything. Now hurry, before we both drown! Oh, by the wae, you should put spaces between your operands and operators to keep it neat."</p>
            <p>"Oh yeah, that's real useful information right now!" you angrily shout back.</p>
            <p>You try some code out:</p>
            <div class='code1'>
                >>>5 * 2 + 2 / 2 <br>
                11.0<br>
                >>>5 * (2 + 2) / 2 <br>
                10.0<br>
                >>>5 * (2 + 2 / 2) <br>
                15.0<br>
                >>>"Help" + "me" <br>
                'Helpme'<br>
            </div>
            
            
            
            <p>Looks like there's nothing else to do now. You had best start spitting some knowledge, before it's too late.</p>
