        <p>As you rub your eyes and groan, you realize you're still at the top of the building with the magic circle. You weren't actually thrown back in time! You just failed to break through the skies into your own world, but at least your progress hasn't completely been lost. What kind of cruel creator would someone to relive such a traumatizing and perilous punishment in this hellscape over and over again? You give thanks for the merciful universe, and steel yourself to try again, for real this time.</p>
