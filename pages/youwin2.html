            <p>You spit some knowledge, and it seems like it's enough. The sound of water stops, and instead, you can now hear some noises like water going down a drain. You breathe a sigh of relief after realizing that you've managed to save your life. And the life of that other guy, too, I guess. You step down from the rock.</p>
            <p>However, that feeling quickly passes as you feel water lapping against your feet. It seems like the water is flowing back into your chamber again, and faster than before!</p>
            <p>"Well, nuts."</p>
            <p>... or so it seems, until the water level recedes again. You have been faked out twice! You won't stand for this. You get the door open and get out of that stupid chamber as fast as you possibly can.</p>
